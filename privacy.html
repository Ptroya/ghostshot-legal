        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        
        <p class="metadata">
            <strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 17, 2025<br>
            <strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 17, 2025<br>
            <strong>Application:</strong> GhostShot Mobile Application
        </p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy governs the collection, use, and disclosure of information by GhostShot ("we," "our," or "us") in connection with the GhostShot mobile application (the "App"). We are committed to protecting user privacy and have designed our App to minimize data collection while providing full functionality.</p>

        <h2>2. Information Collection and Use</h2>
        
        <div class="notice-box">
            <strong>Core Privacy Principle:</strong> GhostShot does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information or user-generated content to our servers or third parties, with the limited exception of anonymized crash reporting data as described in Section 3 below.
        </div>

        <h3>2.1 Personal Information</h3>
        <p>We do not collect, store, or process any personal information, including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Names, email addresses, or contact information</li>
            <li>Location data or geolocation information</li>
            <li>Device identifiers beyond what is necessary for crash reporting</li>
            <li>User behavior or analytics data</li>
            <li>Advertising identifiers</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.2 Photo and Media Content</h3>
        <p>All photographs captured or processed within the App are stored exclusively on your device in the application's private sandbox storage. Specifically:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Photos are never uploaded to our servers or any cloud storage service</li>
            <li>Photo content remains entirely under your control</li>
            <li>No image analysis, facial recognition, or content scanning is performed on our servers</li>
            <li>Photos are only accessible by the App and are isolated from other applications</li>
            <li>Deletion of the App results in permanent removal of all stored photos</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Crash Reporting and Diagnostics</h2>
        
        <h3>3.1 Firebase Crashlytics</h3>
        <p>The App uses Firebase Crashlytics, a crash reporting service provided by Google LLC, to help us identify and resolve technical issues. Firebase Crashlytics collects limited, anonymized technical information when the App crashes or encounters errors.</p>

        <h3>3.2 Data Collected by Crashlytics</h3>
        <p>Firebase Crashlytics may automatically collect the following technical data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Crash traces and stack traces</li>
            <li>Device model and operating system version</li>
            <li>App version and build number</li>
            <li>Timestamp of crash events</li>
            <li>General device state information (memory usage, disk space, battery level at time of crash)</li>
            <li>Installation UUID (a randomly generated identifier that does not identify you personally)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.3 What is NOT Collected by Crashlytics</h3>
        <p>Firebase Crashlytics does not collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your photos or any image content</li>
            <li>Personal identifying information</li>
            <li>User-generated content or text</li>
            <li>Precise location data</li>
            <li>Contact lists or address book information</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.4 Purpose and Legal Basis</h3>
        <p>Crash data is collected solely for the purpose of improving App stability and user experience. This processing is based on our legitimate interest in maintaining a functional and reliable application. You may opt out of crash reporting through your device settings, though this may limit our ability to diagnose and fix issues affecting your experience.</p>

        <h2>4. OCR and Text Recognition</h2>
        
        <h3>4.1 On-Device Processing</h3>
        <p>The App includes an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) feature that allows you to extract text from photos. This feature operates entirely on your device using Apple's native Vision framework.</p>

        <h3>4.2 OCR Data Handling</h3>
        <p>Text recognition is performed with the following privacy safeguards:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All OCR processing occurs locally on your device</li>
            <li>No images or extracted text are transmitted to our servers</li>
            <li>No images or text are sent to third-party services</li>
            <li>Recognized text is stored only in the App's private sandbox alongside the associated photo</li>
            <li>Text data is subject to the same automatic deletion schedule as the photos</li>
            <li>No OCR data is used for machine learning, model training, or any other purpose</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Local Data Storage</h2>
        
        <h3>5.1 App Sandbox Storage</h3>
        <p>All data created within GhostShot is stored in the application's private sandbox directory, which is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Isolated from other applications on your device</li>
            <li>Not accessible without your device passcode or biometric authentication</li>
            <li>Protected by iOS security measures</li>
            <li>Automatically removed upon app deletion</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.2 Automatic Deletion</h3>
        <p>Photos within the App are automatically deleted based on user-selected retention periods (ranging from 30 minutes to 1 week, or immediate deletion after sharing). This process:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Operates entirely on your device without network connectivity</li>
            <li>Results in permanent deletion of photo files and associated metadata</li>
            <li>Includes a 24-hour recycle bin feature for recovery of accidentally deleted items</li>
            <li>Cannot be reversed once the recycle bin period expires</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5.3 User Preferences</h3>
        <p>Application settings and preferences (language selection, theme, default retention period) are stored using iOS UserDefaults. This information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Remains on your device</li>
            <li>Is not synchronized or backed up to our servers</li>
            <li>Is removed when you uninstall the application</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Device Permissions</h2>
        
        <p>The App requires the following permissions to function:</p>

        <h3>6.1 Camera Access (Required)</h3>
        <p>Camera permission is necessary to capture photos within the App. The camera is only activated when you explicitly use the capture feature.</p>

        <h3>6.2 Photo Library Access (Optional)</h3>
        <p>Photo library access is requested only when you choose to save a photo from the App to your device's Photos library. This permission is not required for basic App functionality. The App cannot access existing photos in your library without your explicit authorization for each access.</p>

        <p>You may manage these permissions at any time through your device's Settings application under Privacy & Security.</p>

        <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
        
        <p>The App does not integrate with third-party analytics, advertising networks, or social media services, with the sole exception of Firebase Crashlytics as described in Section 3. The App uses only native Apple frameworks for all core functionality.</p>

        <h2>8. Data Security</h2>
        
        <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect data stored on your device:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All data is stored in the iOS application sandbox with system-level access controls</li>
            <li>No network transmission of user content occurs (eliminating transmission-related security risks)</li>
            <li>Automatic deletion mechanisms reduce data retention exposure</li>
            <li>No server infrastructure eliminates remote breach vectors</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
        
        <p>The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 or any other age threshold defined by applicable law. Because we do not collect personal information from any users, the App is compliant with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and similar regulations.</p>

        <h2>10. International Data Transfers</h2>
        
        <p>Because all user data is stored locally on your device and not transmitted to our servers, international data transfer considerations do not apply to user-generated content. The limited crash reporting data transmitted to Firebase Crashlytics may be transferred to and processed in the United States and other countries where Google maintains infrastructure. Google's data processing practices are governed by their privacy policy and applicable data protection agreements.</p>

        <h2>11. Data Retention</h2>
        
        <p>User-generated photos and associated data are retained only for the duration specified by your selected retention period. After this period expires (and after any applicable recycle bin period), data is permanently and irreversibly deleted from your device.</p>

        <p>Crash reporting data collected by Firebase Crashlytics is retained according to Google's data retention policies, typically for a period of 90 days.</p>

        <h2>12. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        
        <p>Given that we do not collect personal information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>No personal data exists in our systems to access, correct, or delete</li>
            <li>Data portability rights do not apply as no data is stored centrally</li>
            <li>All user-generated content is under your direct control on your device</li>
            <li>You may opt out of crash reporting through your device settings or by contacting us</li>
        </ul>

        <p>To exercise any privacy rights or request information about crash reporting, please contact us using the information provided in Section 15.</p>

        <h2>13. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        
        <p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Changes will be effective upon posting to this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. Material changes will be communicated through the App or other appropriate means. Your continued use of the App following the posting of changes constitutes your acceptance of such changes.</p>

        <h2>14. Legal Compliance</h2>
        
        <p>This Privacy Policy is designed to comply with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Apple App Store Review Guidelines</li>
            <li>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - EU</li>
