            <ul>

                <li>Once permanently deleted, photos <strong>cannot be recovered by any means</strong>, including by us or through data recovery services</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5.2 No Liability for Data Loss</h3>
            <p>We expressly disclaim all liability and responsibility for any loss of photos or data, including but not limited to loss resulting from:</p>

            <h3>5.3 User Backup Responsibility</h3>
            <p class="caps-text">IT IS ENTIRELY YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to save or back up any photos you wish to retain permanently. We strongly recommend:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Saving important photos to your device's Photos library before the retention period expires</li>

        </div>

        <h2>6. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        
        <p class="caps-text">THE APP IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.</p>

        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement</li>
            <li>Warranties that the App will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free</li>
            <li>Warranties that the results obtained from use of the App will be accurate or reliable</li>
            <li>Warranties regarding the quality of any products, services, information, or other material obtained through the App</li>
            <li>Warranties that any errors in the App will be corrected</li>
        </ul>

        <p>No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from us or through the App shall create any warranty not expressly stated in these Terms.</p>

        <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        
        <p class="caps-text">TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL WE, OUR AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS, OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages, including but not limited to damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses</li>
            <li>Any direct damages exceeding the amount you paid to us for the App in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim (which, if the App is free, shall be zero)</li>
            <li>Any loss of photos, data, or content, regardless of cause</li>
            <li>Any damages resulting from: (a) your use or inability to use the App; (b) unauthorized access to or alteration of your photos or data; (c) any conduct or content of any third party on or through the App; or (d) any other matter relating to the App</li>

        <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations may not apply to you. In such jurisdictions, our liability shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>

        <h2>16. General Provisions</h2>
        
        <h3>16.1 Entire Agreement</h3>
        <p>These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other legal notices published by us through the App, constitute the entire agreement between you and us concerning the App and supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements, representations, warranties, and understandings with respect to the App.</p>

        <h3>16.2 Severability</h3>
        <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable while preserving its intent, or if such modification is not possible, such provision shall be severed from these Terms. The remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.</p>

        <h3>16.3 Waiver</h3>
        <p>No waiver of any provision of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such provision or any other provision. Our failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>

        <p>You may not assign, transfer, or delegate your rights or obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent. We may assign, transfer, or delegate our rights and obligations under these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms shall bind and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.</p>
